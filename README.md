# Mutatris for Android
Version of my game Mutatris for Android using OpenGL ES.
Just another project I worked on to practice.

New Features:

You can now rotate the orientation of your Android device and the game will adjust. Also contains new graphics.

How to play:

This game is meant to be played on a tablet with a good sized screen or Android TV.
Swipe up to change the order of the blocks. Swipe left and right to move the blocks left and right. Connect 4 of the same color in either a horizontal, vertical, or square to clear the blocks and increase your score. When there is no block beneath another block it moves down until there is a block or hits the bottom of the grid. As you go it will get faster. Also contains 3 difficulty levels.
